General Feedback for Project 1
==============================

1.  Project creation
--------------------
- Name the Project "trisolver", which will create trisolver.exe
- Solution can be named "Project 1"
- Set Project Properties to: C Language Standard to ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20)

2.  Project submission
----------------------
- delete all debug and release directories using 'vsclean' a VS Solution utility, which will retain solution folders (see Projects folder for instructions and a link to the download)
- close all files and collapse the project in VS Solution Explorer
- set to Release mode for submission, based on the assumption all debugging is complete
- ZIP the entire cleaned Visual Studio Solution, and then upload that zipped file

3.  Warnings and runtime errors
-------------------------------
- correct all warnings before submission
- correct all infinite loops before submission

4. Input Validation
-------------------
- match the error message to the .exe for incorrect input

5. Documentation and comments
-----------------------------
- provide file documentation (include Author Name, Due Date, Purpose, Version)
- provide function documentation (see Projects folder for instructions)
- inclusion of web resources is a good idea

6. Testing the demo executable
------------------------------
- run the demo with input for the four triangle strings, which values are assigned to which properties? Match that assignment, then solve for remaining properties.

7. Declaring variables and constants
------------------------------------
- use std::numbers:pi for PI constant
- do not declare variables in Global namespace
- Avoid declaring all variables at the top of a program or function (an intro Java practice), instead declare as needed in place.

8. Code readability
-------------------
- reduce excess whitespace within your code
- match braces for code constructs
- delete any unused functions or variables
- use meaningful variable names
- delete any commented-out code blocks!
